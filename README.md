ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project: A Streamlit app for Speaker Verification! ðŸ”Š
This app allows users to either record their voice or upload an audio file. It then generates and saves signal embeddings to a CSV file. To verify a speaker, users can record or upload another audio sample, and the app will compare the embeddings to check for a match.
ðŸŽ¯ Key Features:
Record or upload voice samples
Generate and save embeddings to CSV
Verify speaker identity with ease
